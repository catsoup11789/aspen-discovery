No trap can contain him. He is Scott Free, the worldwide celebrity sensation known as Mister Miracle, and he is the greatest escape artist who ever lived. But can he pull off the ultimate trick--and escape death itself? Something has gone horribly wrong with the perfect life that Scott and his wife, Big Barda, have made for themselves on Earth. With war raging between their homeworlds of Apokolips and New Genesis, Scott's cruel adoptive father, Darkseid, seems to have finally found the Anti-Life Equation--the weapon that will give him total victory. As the mountains of bodies on both sides grow ever higher, only Mister Miracle can stop the slaughter and restore peace. But the terrible power of the Anti-Life Equation may already be at work in his own mind, warping his reality and shattering the fragile happiness he's found with the woman he loves. Is death the trap that's been waiting for him all along? Or is it life itself? And what price will Scott Free have to pay to learn the answer?"--cProvided by publisher.00aMister Miraclec(Fictitious character)vComic books, strips, etc.vFiction. 0aGood and evilvComic books, strips, etc.vFiction. 7aComics (Graphic works)2lcgft 7aGraphic novels.2lcgft 7aScience fiction comics.2lcgft 7aFiction.2lcgft1 aGerads, Mitch,eartist.1 aCowles, Clayton,eletterer.1 aDerington, Nickecover artist.  aa2903516  aMARCIVE1120  aSCD/JT/20201027  aC0bPX0  a(OCoLC)1154912595  a95  aKING (GRAPHIC)wALPHANUMc1i31534002778745d12/21/2022e11/29/2022f5/13/2021g1lGRPHCNVmOBDn1p$28.24rYsYtBOOKu10/14/2020xBOOKzADULT0FICTION1LG_SCIFI
